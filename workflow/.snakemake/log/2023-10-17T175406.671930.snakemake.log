MissingOutputException in rule prep_snps in file /pollard/home/mgoldman/micro-glmm/workflow/Snakefile_new, line 21:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/pollard/data/projects/mwas-projects//output/102478.GRM.tsv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
